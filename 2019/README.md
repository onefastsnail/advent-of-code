This year I chose [Elm](https://elm-lang.org) as my weapon of choice to solve the puzzles. Why? To be honest I just find writing Elm a lovely experience üòç.

## Usage

Each Elm module exposes all of its values so we can use in the REPL.

1. [Install Elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install/elm.html)
1. `$ elm repl`
1. `$ import DayX`
1. `$ DayX.getAnswer DayX.puzzleInput`
